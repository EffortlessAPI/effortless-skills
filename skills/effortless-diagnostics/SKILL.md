  Use when diagnosing ERB project health — validating DAG integrity, checking for
  broken FK targets, finding JOIN anti-patterns in application code, migrating
  legacy code from base table reads to view reads, or running diagnostic queries.

  **Scope (load gate):** Effortless projects only — project root must contain `effortless.json` AND a CLAUDE.md identifying the project as ERB methodology. Do NOT load otherwise.

# ERB Diagnostics & Migration

## Diagnostic Queries Against the Rulebook (PREFERRED — do these first)

### Validate DAG (check for missing FK targets)

```bash
cat effortless-rulebook.json | python3 -c "
import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin)
tables={k for k,v in d.items() if isinstance(v,dict) and 'schema' in v}
for k,v in d.items():
  if isinstance(v,dict) and 'schema' in v:
    for f in v['schema']:
      if f['type']=='relationship' and f.get('RelatedTo') not in tables:
        print(f'  BROKEN FK: {k}.{f[\"name\"]} -> {f.get(\"RelatedTo\")} (not found)')
"
```

## Diagnostic Queries Against Generated Code (secondary)

```bash
# Find JOIN anti-patterns in Go code
grep -r "JOIN" cmd/api/*.go | grep -v "// " | wc -l
# Should be ~0 for a healthy codebase

# Find base table reads
grep -rE "FROM (bids|rfps|companies|contacts|documents)\s" cmd/api/*.go
# Should mostly be INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs

# Find view usage
grep -r "FROM vw_" cmd/api/*.go | wc -l
# Should be high - this is where reads happen
```

## Migration Path for Legacy Code

When fixing JOIN anti-patterns:

1. Identify what fields the JOIN is fetching
2. Verify those fields exist in the source view (check the rulebook first!)
3. Remove the JOIN, select from view directly
4. If field is missing, extend the view via Airtable (not the app code)

### Before
```go
rows, _ := db.Query(`
    SELECT b.bid_id, b.rfp, c.company_name, r.title
    FROM bids b
    JOIN companies c ON b.submitted_by_vendor = c.companie_id
    JOIN rfps r ON b.rfp = r.rfp_id
    WHERE b.bid_id = $1`, bidID)
```

### After
```go
rows, _ := db.Query(`
    SELECT bid_id, rfp, company_name, rfp_title
    FROM vw_bids
    WHERE bid_id = $1`, bidID)
```
